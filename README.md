# Face Detection and Recognition Model from Scratch
This project is a face detection and recognition model that is built from scratch using Python programming language and various computer vision libraries. The model uses deep learning techniques to detect and recognize faces in real-time video streams.

# Features:
1. Detects faces in real-time video streams </br>
2. Recognizes faces of people that are present in the video stream </br>
3. Capable of identifying multiple faces at the same time </br>
4. User-friendly interface for easy usage </br>
5. Robust and reliable face detection and recognition </br>

# Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. </br>
2. Install the required libraries using the following command: </br>
           pip install -r requirements.txt </br>
3. Download the pre-trained model from here and place it inside the models directory.</br>

# Usage:
1.Navigate to the cloned directory and run the main.py file using the following command:</br>
           python main.py </br>
2.The program will automatically detect and recognize faces in the video stream and display the results on the screen.</br>
